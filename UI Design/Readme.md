# Python For Kids!

This folder contains the sample design of the project. The design was made with the easy usability for the kids. Used simple color pallette for making cheerful and enjoyable for the kids who are aged 7+. 
The design was made as simple as possible. Animations will be added later on with the code

Please open the _PDF_ file for the simple top down layout and open the _.fig_ file for the prototype



**_N.B. The design may change later as per to group discussion and new features might be added._**
